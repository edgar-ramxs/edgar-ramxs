# ü§î <b>About Me</b>
<h3 align='left'>
  Final year student of Computer Science Engineering at the Andr√©s Bello University, with a solid background in data science, optimization and artificial intelligence. Oriented towards specialization in data science, cybersecurity and software development. 
</h3>

+ ü§ñ I have developed several projects in the field of artificial intelligence, including both machine learning and deep learning projects.

+ üë®‚Äçüíª I have applied agile methodologies such as CRISP-DM for data science and data mining projects. In addition, I have applied SCRUM for software development projects.

+ üß¨ For the university, I created a [repository](https://doi.org/10.60483/UNAB/S97XGA) where I compiled numerous bioinformatics exercises from [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/) to help Bioinformatics students at Andr√©s Bello University understand data structures and how to use Python.

+ ü•∑ I'm a beginner in cybersecurity, but I am knowledgeable about issues and attacks. Additionally, I obtained a Network Defense Essentials certificate from EC-Council. Also, as I study, I work on Hack The Box machines; here are [my notes](https://github.com/edgar-ramxs/HTB).

+ ü´µ By the way, I know how to use Excel. Greetings to HR Recruiters and Talent Acquisition Managers.
